## Description

This application is a code quiz powered by javaScript. This required creating a timed multiple choice quiz on items learned in BootCamp so far. This was created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A separate HTML document was created to store high scores. 

When the application is opened in the browser, you must click the start button to begin. The start button then disappears and you are presented with the first question and answers and the timer begins. As you select your answers, you are taken through the quiz. If you click on the High Scores button, you are directed to another webpage which should display high scores.

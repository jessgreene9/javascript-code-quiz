## Description

This application is a code quiz powered by javaScript. This required creating a timed multiple choice quiz on items learned in BootCamp so far. This was created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A separate HTML document was created to store high scores. 

When the application is opened in the browser, you must click the start button to begin. The start button then disappears and you are presented with the first question and answers and the timer begins. As you select your answers, you are alerted if they are correct or wrong. If you select a wrong answer, 10 seconds are removed from your timer. At the end of the game, the time you have left is your score and you are presented with a form to enter your initials. If you click on the High Scores button, you are directed to another webpage which display high scores that have been saved in local storage.
